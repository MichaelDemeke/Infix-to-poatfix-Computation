# Stack 

This code simply receives any infixes code and change it into a prefix and calculate the result. it even takes decimal points and computes the result and also outputs their prefix form,
it is done by using Stacks
The Programming language is C++.
 The program initially takes in the input as a string, sort and store it on a .txt file then compute the result by retrieve it from the file and also change it into a prefix format 
 
There is no input check, so inputting alphabets or special characters. Mathematical operations are allowed ( +,-,*,/,%,^,())
